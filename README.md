#### CS-499 Enhancement One - Pet Management System

Designed and developed during my IT-145 course, this system enables efficient management of pet stays at care facilities. It handles operations from recording pet details to cost calculation, influenced by factors like pet type, stay duration, and special care requirements. The system also integrates discount handling and coupon code application, enhancing user interaction and operational efficiency.

#### CS-499 Enhancement Two - HashTable Project

Initially developed for my CS-260 course in C++, this project aimed to deepen my understanding of data management using advanced hash table algorithms. It later transitioned to Python to take advantage of robust libraries, improving the efficiency and maintainability of the code. The project emphasized collaborative development through Git, with regular peer reviews enhancing the solution.

#### CS-499 Enhancement Three - Employees Table

This project was created for DAD-220 course involves integrating MySQL and data mining techniques to analyze employee salary data using the K-means clustering algorithm. It includes sophisticated database management features such as stored procedures and triggers, which optimizes the data handling and analysis processes.

### Alignment with Educational Goals and Professional Aspirations

Each project aligns with the SNHU Computer Science program outcomes, demonstrating:
- **Collaborative Environments:** By leveraging platforms like GitHub for version control and project collaboration, I enhanced my ability to work effectively in team settings, facilitating continuous improvement and integration.
- **Professional-quality Communications:** Maintaining clear and comprehensive documentation throughout the project lifecycle ensured that all components were understandable and accessible, reinforcing professional communication standards.
- **Algorithmic Design and Evaluation:** My projects consistently applied complex algorithms and computational logic to solve practical problems efficiently, showcasing my capability to design and evaluate robust computing solutions.
- **Innovative Techniques in Computing:** From object-oriented programming to the application of advanced data structures like AVL Trees, my work reflected a strong foundation in utilizing innovative and effective computing practices.
- **Security Mindset:** Across all projects, I emphasized data integrity and security, incorporating practices to mitigate vulnerabilities and ensure the secure handling of information.

### Challenges and Learnings

Throughout my capstone and other course projects, I encountered various challenges, such as implementing peak and off-peak pricing in the Pet Management System and managing data scalability and security in the HashTable project. These challenges were invaluable learning opportunities that taught me the importance of scalable design and proactive security measures.

### Conclusion

The culmination of my experiences at SNHU has not only tested my technical abilities but has also significantly enhanced my project management and problem-solving skills. This journey has prepared me for the multifaceted challenges of the professional world, where I am eager to apply my knowledge and skills to contribute to impactful technological solutions. As I transition from a student to a professional in the tech industry, I am equipped to deliver innovative, efficient, and secure software solutions, driving forward the goals of any organization.
